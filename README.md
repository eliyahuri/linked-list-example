# 🔗 The Most Epic LinkedList Ever Created

## What is this sorcery? 🧙‍♂️

Welcome to the ULTIMATE LinkedList implementation - where nodes link up like a conga line at a data structure party! This isn't your grandma's boring LinkedList, oh no. This is a LinkedList with STYLE.

## Features 🚀

- Links nodes together like a boss
- Traverses forward AND backward (because we're not savages)
- Makes other data structures jealous
- Built with React + TypeScript (because we're fancy like that)
- Visualizes the LinkedList in a way that would make computer science professors weep tears of joy

## Why Use This? 🤔

Because regular arrays are SO last century! When you need to insert or delete elements with the elegance of a ninja, LinkedLists are your best friend. Plus, this implementation comes with a sleek visual interface that makes understanding LinkedLists as easy as eating pie 🥧.

## Getting Started 🏃‍♂️

1. Clone this bad boy
2. Run `pnpm install` (because we're too cool for regular npm)
3. `pnpm dev` to witness the magic
4. Pick your jaw up off the floor

## Tech Stack 🛠️

- React 19 (living on the bleeding edge)
- TypeScript (because we like our types like we like our coffee - strong)
- Vite (gotta go fast! ⚡)
- TailwindCSS (making things pretty)
- Vercel Analytics (tracking all the minds we're blowing)
